## Line Follower Robot

A line follower robot is a simple kind of autonomous robot that senses the road/track from its sensor and rotates its motor such that the movement of car/robot maintains that road. An additional sensor may prevent that car from the accident and a number of other sensors do different tasks.

## Our robot

When you talk about the robot, an image of a humanoid robot comes into your minde but theoretically, they all are the same walking in a road or driving in a road that has a similar algorithm. The prime goal for both the task is to reach its final point without an accident. Where accidents may be defined by a set of rules. Sometimes they are too weared, like after 20sec your car will blast and you will disquilifed.

So, we are going to make a line follower robot. A lien followe robot is an autonomous robot that follows a track/road/line. In my demonstration, I am using a black and white line. Means track is either black or white and the complementary color is out of track. 
Our robot can able to detect any (given above) color of track and can reach from starting to ending position without any external help or hand-touch. The robot can also able to handle if the track is lost and can able to privent physical accidents with any object. In some cases, our robot can also detect walls. Between the starting and ending point, our robot can also detect some special marking called a checkpoint.
And another algorithm can find the shortest path between the starting and ending points.
