# How to make a autonomous robot &#129302;

    beauty lies in the eye of the beholder.
    ~ Prashant Kumar

Making a robot is an art, it is not just connecting two motors with microcontroller and applying 12V power supply. You can make an autonomous robot using a set of Infrared(IR) LED. A simple logic gate can do basic switching. We use a microcontroller to perform some complex calculation, memory(remembering road data) and many tasks which are not solved using a simple circuit.

*A mico-controller is a small processor that is closely related to the processor inside a computer.*

A are need an artist, dedication and patience. In my article I am going to make some autonomous robot and compare it. I will start for beginning and cover almost every aspect of bot making
